# 1. Initialize Retriever and Generator

# Load a pre-trained RAG model and its components
# The RAG model internally handles both retrieval and generation
rag_tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-token-base")
rag_model = RagForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-token-base")

# 2. Prepare Documents (for the retriever's knowledge base)
# In a real-world scenario, you would have a large corpus of documents
# For this example, we'll use a small list of strings
documents = [
    "The capital of France is Paris.",
    "Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.",
    "The Louvre Museum is a famous art museum in Paris.",
    "The River Seine flows through Paris.",
    "France is a country in Western Europe."
]

# You would typically preprocess and embed these documents and store them in a vector database
# For simplicity, the `RagRetriever` handles this implicitly if you provide a `dataset` argument
# when initializing it, or you can manually manage the document embeddings.

# 3. Formulate a Query
query = "Tell me about the capital of France and its famous landmarks."

# 4. Perform Retrieval and Generation
# Encode the query
input_ids = rag_tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Generate a response using the RAG model
# The model will internally retrieve relevant documents and use them to inform the generation
generated_ids = rag_model.generate(input_ids)

# Decode the generated response
response = rag_tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]

print(f"Query: {query}")
print(f"Generated Response: {response}")
